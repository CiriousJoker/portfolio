I develop websites, apps and sometimes random things that spark my interest :)\n\n
I have tried lots of languages and frameworks over the years. Right now, I like a combination of Flutter, Typescript, and Firebase the most.
As you can guess by the quote above, I value code quality very highly, but a great UI/UX is also a requirement for everything I do.\n
\n
Don't take my word for it, feel free to check our the projects yourself.\n\n

Have a great day!
